# Akita Assistant (Beta): Your Development Companion ðŸ¤–

Welcome to the beta version of Akita Assistant, your personal ChatGPT for navigating and understanding your local codebase! Akita Assistant serves as a personal GPT for your codebase, offering real-time insights, answers, and documentation to streamline your development process. As we refine Akita's capabilities in this beta phase, we invite you to explore its features and contribute to its evolution.

## Beta Version Disclaimer

Please note that Akita Assistant is currently in beta. We're working hard to improve its functionality and reliability, but there may be occasional bugs or incomplete features. Your feedback is invaluable to us during this phase, as it will help shape the future of Akita Assistant.

## Features âœ¨

- **Code Understanding**: Ask Akita anything about your codebaseâ€”be it functions, classes, or specific lines of codeâ€”and get clear, context-aware explanations.
- **Bug Detection and Suggestions**: Highlight potential issues in your code and receive suggestions for improvements, helping you to maintain a high code quality.
- **Documentation Generation**: Automatically generate documentation for your code to enhance understandability and maintainability.
- **Custom Queries**: Tailor your questions to fit your specific needs, whether it's understanding complex algorithms or getting guidance on best practices.

## How to Use ðŸ’¬

Using Akita Assistant is as straightforward as typing your question into a prompt. Here's how to make the most out of Akita Assistant:

- **Ask Specific Questions**: The more specific your question, the more accurate Akita's response will be. For example, "What does the `calculateInterest` function in `finance.py` do?" is better than "Tell me about `finance.py`."
  
- **Include File Names**: When relevant, include the file name to help Akita understand the context of your question.
  
- **Use Natural Language**: Feel free to ask questions in natural language.

- **Explore Code Patterns and Best Practices**: Beyond understanding specific pieces of code, you can also ask Akita about best coding practices, design patterns, and how to apply them in your codebase.
