## Setup Instructions

Welcome to the development setup for Akita AI. Please follow these instructions to get started:

### Requirements

Before you begin, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Python**: Python version 3.9 or newer. Akita AI uses modern Python features and dependencies that require Python 3.9+.
- **Poetry**: Poetry is used for dependency management and project setup. If not already installed, follow the installation instructions on the [official Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

1. **Fork and Clone the Akita Repository:**
   - Navigate to the [Akita repository on GitHub](https://github.com/gauthierpiarrette/akita-ai) and fork it to your own GitHub account.
   - Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/gauthierpiarrette/akita-ai.git
     cd akita-ai
     ```

2. **Set Up a Development Environment with Poetry:**
   Since Akita AI utilizes Poetry for dependency management and project setup, ensure you have Poetry installed. If you don't have Poetry, you can install it by following the instructions on the [official Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

   - Once Poetry is installed, set up your project environment:
     ```bash
     poetry install
     ```

   This command creates a virtual environment (if one doesn't already exist) and installs both the project's package and development dependencies as specified in `pyproject.toml`.

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   Poetry creates a virtual environment specific to your project to avoid conflicts with other projects or system-wide packages. To activate the virtual environment generated by Poetry, use:
   
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

4. **Install Development Dependencies:**
   Development dependencies such as `pytest`, `pytest-mock`, `black`, `flake8`, and `pre-commit` are essential for running tests, formatting code, and ensuring code quality. These are automatically installed in the previous step (`poetry install`), but you can reinstall or update them anytime with:
   
   ```bash
   poetry update
   ```

5. **Run Tests and Linters:**
   Ensure that all tests pass and your code adheres to formatting and linting standards using the following commands:

   - To run tests with `pytest`:
     ```bash
     poetry run pytest
     ```

   - To check code formatting with `black` (and optionally auto-fix formatting issues):
     ```bash
     poetry run black . --check  # For checking
     poetry run black .          # To auto-fix
     ```

   - To lint your code with `flake8`:
     ```bash
     poetry run flake8
     ```

   - To run `pre-commit` hooks (ensure they are installed first with `poetry run pre-commit install`):
     ```bash
     poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
     ```

6. **Contribute Your Changes:**
   After making changes, push them to your fork and create a pull request to the main Akita AI repository. We welcome contributions, whether adding new features, fixing bugs, or improving documentation!

### Running Akita AI

To run Akita AI, you can easily run its commands via Poetry. Here's how to invoke Akita AI from your project's root directory:

```bash
poetry run akita [command]
```

Replace `[command]` with any of the Akita commands you wish to use, such as `assistant`, `review`, or `add`. For example, to use the Akita Assistant for real-time code insights:

```bash
poetry run akita assistant path/to/your/repo
```

This command will activate the Akita Assistant, offering AI-driven insights and assistance tailored to your codebase.

Thank you for contributing to Akita AI, and happy coding!
