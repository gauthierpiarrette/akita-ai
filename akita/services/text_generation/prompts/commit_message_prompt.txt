Given the content of the code provided, generate a one-sentence commit message following the best software engineering practices. The message should succinctly encapsulate the essence of the changes made. Start with a type of change prefix (e.g., 'feat', 'fix', 'refactor', 'docs', 'test', 'chore'), optionally followed by the scope of the change in parentheses. Conclude with a concise, imperative summary that describes what was done and why, focusing on clarity and relevance without delving into excessive detail. This commit message should be informative, providing clear value to project maintainers and future readers of the project history, while adhering to the structure of: [Type of Change]([Scope of Change]): [Summary].
