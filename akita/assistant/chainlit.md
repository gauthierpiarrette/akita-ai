# Welcome to Akita Assistant (Beta) ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the beta version of Akita Assistant, your personal ChatGPT for navigating and understanding your local codebase! As we fine-tune our systems and enhance Akita's capabilities, we invite developers to explore its features and provide feedback. Designed with developers in mind, Akita Assistant leverages advanced AI technology to offer instant insights, answers, and guidance on your code, making your development process smoother and more efficient.

## Beta Version Disclaimer

Please note that Akita Assistant is currently in beta. We're working hard to improve its functionality and reliability, but there may be occasional bugs or incomplete features. Your feedback is invaluable to us during this phase, as it will help shape the future of Akita Assistant.

## Features âœ¨

- **Code Understanding**: Ask Akita anything about your codebaseâ€”be it functions, classes, or specific lines of codeâ€”and get clear, context-aware explanations.
- **Bug Detection and Suggestions**: Highlight potential issues in your code and receive suggestions for improvements, helping you to maintain a high code quality.
- **Documentation Generation**: Automatically generate documentation for your code to enhance understandability and maintainability.
- **Custom Queries**: Tailor your questions to fit your specific needs, whether it's understanding complex algorithms or getting guidance on best practices.

## How to Use ðŸ’¬

Using Akita Assistant is as straightforward as typing your question into a prompt. Here's how to make the most out of Akita Assistant:

- **Ask Specific Questions**: The more specific your question, the more accurate Akita's response will be. For example, "What does the `calculateInterest` function in `finance.py` do?" is better than "Tell me about `finance.py`."
  
- **Include File Names and Line Numbers**: When relevant, include the file name and, if applicable, the specific line number to help Akita understand the context of your question.
  
- **Use Natural Language**: Feel free to ask questions in natural language. Akita is designed to understand queries just like a human would.

- **Explore Code Patterns and Best Practices**: Beyond understanding specific pieces of code, you can also ask Akita about best coding practices, design patterns, and how to apply them in your codebase.

## Providing Feedback 

We're especially keen to hear about your experiences with Akita Assistant, including:

- Any bugs you encounter
- Features you find particularly useful or that could be improved
- Suggestions for new features or capabilities
